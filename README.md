OVERVIEW :
The provided code is a basic calculator program written in Python. 
It allows users to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:
Prompting for Input: The program starts by asking the user to input two numbers. These inputs are then converted to floating-point numbers to handle decimal values.
Selecting an Operation: The user is presented with a menu to choose an operation. They can select addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
Performing the Operation: Based on the user's choice, the program performs the selected arithmetic operation on the two numbers:

If the user chooses addition, the two numbers are added.
If the user chooses subtraction, the second number is subtracted from the first.
If the user chooses multiplication, the two numbers are multiplied.
If the user chooses division, the first number is divided by the second. The program includes a check to prevent division by zero, which would result in an error.
Displaying the Result: The result of the chosen operation is printed to the console in a readable format. If the user inputs an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.

This simple calculator demonstrates basic user input handling, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in Python.
